Difference between pipe(|) and arrow(>)
    >                       write redirect, used to pipe output into files, usually used with files
    >>                      will append the O/P to file.
    |                       to pipe/combine different different processes
    >&2                     to capture all o/p. '>' prints only stdio, adding '&2' prints error o/p also
    
nano <filename> - to view the content of file in user friendly way

cat <filename>  - concatinate into the console IO, basically print out the file content in console

head <filename> - takes first 10 lines and outputs it
